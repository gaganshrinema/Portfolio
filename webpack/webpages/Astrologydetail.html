                    relationships. The present of Saturn in your career sector brought many challenges and tough
                    situations to deal with. You were struggling to get promoted and was force to deal with work
                    colleagues who made your life difficult. hidden competition and unfair changes at your work schedule
                    kept you feeling frustrated. Some of you took on a new job yet eventually end up struggling with the
                    new challenges. others suffered quietly waiting for a better opportunity to arise. Until April 2020
                    you will not be free to do things your way! later after July you will be able to improve your work
                    statues and find the right way to express your leadership. The best you can do this year is to
                    except the recent work changes and wait until the second half of 2020 to find a better career
                    opportunity. Your financial situation can improve this year if you avoid taking unnecessary risk.be
                    more careful with your spending and more efficient with running the family budget. A decision to
                    invest your savings in stocks or business can end up in a loss, especially if you fail to read
                    correctly the current market conditions.

          <h2>HOROSCOPE FOR THE YEAR 2020</h2>
          <h6>Aquarius</h6>
          <h3>Work and finance:</h3>
          <p>2020 will be a interesting yet a complicate year.Saturn enters your sign this year. you will have to take
            more career responsibility’s and be more efficient in your money management. Saturn is the teacher! It
            brings
            <span> restriction and limitation</span>
            to your life, you will have to learn self-control and need to be more realistic. Those who recently found a
            new job will feel this pressure. With patient and with using your natural creativity you can easily take
            over any of these challenges. During the first half of the year you will be busy with long term business
            plans. February will be difficult month for job seekers due to the Mercury retro weeks. If you do find a new
            job or starting a new business then it will be wise to wait until April before you start. Due to Venus retro
            May & June are sensitive months for finance these months can bring delays in your work schedule. apart from
            all these temporarily aspects you have Neptune in your money sector, Neptune is there to stay until 2025!
            Neptune can bring illusions, confusion and bad judgment! In this period, you must take advice from
            professionals avoid taking financial risks and listen to your inner voice! Financial mistakes now can have a
            long-term effect on you and will be difficult to correct.
          </p>
          <h2>Love and relationships: </h2>
          <p>
            A very important year for your family life. Singles can suddenly fall in love this year ; some of you will
            consider marriage. The first half of the year is not recommended time for marriage. The period from July
            onward is a better time. Relationship that will start after July will quickly tern serious. Uranus in your
            home and living sector show a possibility of moving a house.do not sell a property before you find your new
