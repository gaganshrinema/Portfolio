              <h1>THE LIGHT</h1>
              <p>
                "The Light" is not a story, a theory or a new meditation philosophy. It is a healing, spiritual mantra, an
                explanation of the source of man's existence and relevance. The source is light and this light is the
                quintessence of all existence.
                We are all basically enlightened, only waiting to be awakened. This beautiful exploration helps us
                discover the truth within. Finding that truth is the key to becoming a witness to one's own being and
                brings with it an understanding of how we create our own reality and suffering. Ultimate healing can come
                from the clarity that understanding this message brings.
                The text can help you unveil your inner light and lead you to deep self-realization and an illumination of
                your consciousness. Simply reading these truths can set you on the healing path to your natural
                destination of merging with the source.
